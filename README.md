# Spivak's Calculus

This repo is in conjunction with The Yellow Pigs Society, a study group started for studying Michael Spivak's Calculus.
It contains LaTeX source code of notes, proofs, and articles written about Spivak's Calculus and related texts on mathematical proofs.

## Getting Started

This will get you up and running.

### Dependencies

First, set up a LaTeX environment.

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
    - [Guide for Mac Install](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/LaTeX/)
- [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index.html) (note: already installed on Mac with Homebrew install)

#### Optional

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [LaTeX-Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop)

### Hello World

To set up your first LaTeX file, save this into a `hello_world.tex`.
You can find this example under `000-getting-started/000-latex`.

```
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, world!
\end{document}
```

Then, open a terminal, and run this command.

```
xelatex hello_world.tex
```

This should produce a pdf file that you can read, along with a few other files. 

(I've chosen to use the `xelatex` command instead of the `latex` command, because it `xelatex` produces a .pdf directly, while you need a few more steps to get a .pdf if you use the `latex` command.)

I'll leave learning about those other steps and files as an exercise for the reader. ðŸ˜‰

Congratulations!

For real projects, I recommend you use one of the LaTeX GUI environments that are mentioned above to help speed up your writing.
